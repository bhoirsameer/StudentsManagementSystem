After launching the project, the initial step involves the admin logging in to the system. 
Once logged in, the admin gains access to functionalities like adding courses for different 
departments and adding trainers corresponding to each department. The courses added by the 
admin will be showcased to students who come for inquiries.

On the homepage, students can click on the "Enquiry" section, where they provide their basic 
details. Afterward, students can view all available courses and enroll in the ones they are 
interested in. If they log in to the system, they will have the option to upgrade their enrolled
courses.

In the trainer's login area, trainers can view information about all students.
